    /// Depending on the implementation, it may be sufficient to call the game's own resize method when the offsets change.
    /// <para>How to achieve that?</para>
    /// Since the games are required to be responsive anyway, we suggest making the main canvas or container element dependent on the offset values in addition to the size of the window.
    /// So the game should theoretically behave as if it were in an iFrame that we don't stretch to full height and/or width.
    /// Of course, the correct technical implementation depends on the game and cannot be generalized.
    /// In some games, you can achieve your goal with pure CSS adjustments.Others require an(additional) change in the engine's resize method, in which, for example, the value of window.innerHeight has to be reduced by <c>GameInterface.getOffsets().bottom</c> to create an area of a certain height under the game.
    /// <para>Advice of the day</para>
